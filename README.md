# Ldap-Server

This project demonstrates the setup and basic usage of an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server on an Ubuntu environment. LDAP is widely used for centralized authentication, directory management, and access control in networks and applications. This guide will walk you through configuring an OpenLDAP server, creating sample users and groups, and running essential LDAP commands to query and manage entries.

## Project Overview
In this demonstration, you will:

Set up OpenLDAP on an Ubuntu server
Configure and structure the LDAP directory
Add sample entries (users and groups) to the directory
Query LDAP entries using common commands
Demonstrate basic replication for a scalable LDAP environment (optional)
The project also includes a short, lightweight video demonstration showing the final setup in action, highlighting core LDAP commands and interactions.

## Technologies Used
Ubuntu: Server environment
OpenLDAP: LDAP server implementation
LDAP Utilities: Command-line tools for querying and managing the LDAP server

Getting Started
To replicate this setup on your machine, clone this repository and follow the instructions in SETUP.md. Ensure you have an Ubuntu environment or a similar Linux setup ready.
